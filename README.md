# apolloGraphQL_ART_RESTAPI
I create an ApolloGraphQL server, designed its schema,  resolver and dataSource to populate the data from a REST API

To run this project:
1) Open terminal, cd to server/src folder, then run node index.js
2) open another terminal, cd to client folder then run npm start
3) Open web browser and go to localhost:3000, wait for a few second you will see the data queried from a REST API
